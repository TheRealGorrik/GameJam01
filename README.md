# GameJam01

This is a simple console base game writen in JavaScript as my first entry into a Game Jam session.

I did not have a computer for this game jam and wrote most of this on my phone.

To run this, simply clone the repository and install Node.js

After Node is installed, you can just enter the following command to run the app
```node main.js```

Follow the prompts to play the game

Note: this game is not complete.
