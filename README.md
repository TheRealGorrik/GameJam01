# GameJam01

This is a simple console base game writen in JavaScript as my first entry into a Game Jam session.

I did not have a computer for this game jam and wrote most of this on my phone.

To run this, simply clone the repository, install Node.js, run `npm install` in the root project directory within a terminal

After Node is installed and all the packages are installed, you can just enter the following command within a terminal to run the app

`node main.js`

Follow the prompts to play the game

Note: this game is not complete.
